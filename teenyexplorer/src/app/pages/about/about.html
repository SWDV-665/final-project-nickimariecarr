      Teeny Tiny Explorers was created with parents and children in mind. These days it can be difficult to get away from the technology and to explore the world around us. There is so much to find online, and so many exciting things that the idea of going outside might seem hard. However, you can still have fun outside! There are still exciting things to do and learn. That is why Teeny Tiny Explorers was created, to get children outside again. To get parents outside again. To discover the world outside of our phones, tablets, and technologies. Children and parents deserve a break from all that is online and on television. But thinking of ideas can seem tiring and something we want to avoid. No one likes planning, at least no one we know. That's why we created this app. To make things easier for parent to find ideas to get outside and have fun, and have ideas that will get their kids loving being away from the television. Learning and exploring all that nature has to offer your child will create memories that they will hold forever. These are the types of memories they will carry with them long after you are gone. We created this app to help you, make memories.

      In the ideas tab you will find ideas, which we will update weekly ! You will be able to favorite the ideas and save them for a later time. We have also enable a map, and working on building some cool features with this. There is also an events page! This events page will be update every week as well and will have cool and exciting meetups and online events that teach your child all about nature, and life skills. We are excited you are here, let's explore the world together!
